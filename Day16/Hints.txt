Hint1 :  Calculate the final vector of how the robot travels after executing all instructions once - it consists of a change in position plus a change in direction.

Hint2 : The robot stays in the circle iff (looking at the final vector) it changes direction (ie. doesn't stay pointing north), or it moves 0.
